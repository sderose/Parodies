=============================
The Road Not Taken-- Robert Frost
(parody by Steve DeRose)

Two ways diverged as my taggers worked,
and sorry I could not mark up both
and be one editor, long I stood
as rend'ring one as far as I could
t'ward where it pleased the typesetters.

Then tagged the other, though not as fair,
yet having perhaps the better claim,
because it was pointy and descriptive;
though as for that, the software there
rendered them really about the same,

And both that morning equally led
to griefs no step had trodden full.
Oh, I marked the first for XSLT!
Yet knowing how tag leads on to tag,
I doubted if I should ever return.

I shall be parsing texts with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two ways diverged in a work, and I,
I took the one less typeset by,
And that has made all the difference.


=============================
The Road Not Taken-- Robert Frost

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.

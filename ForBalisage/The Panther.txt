=======================================
The Panther -- Rainer Maria Rilke
(parody by Steve DeRose)

His vision, from constantly tagging paras,
has known no theory, thus it cannot hold
anything else. It seems to him there are
only paras; and behind the paras, no world.

As he traces out ranked cycles, divs and divs over,
improvement of his elements applied
is like a ritual dance around an author
of whom the mighty will stands analyzed.

Only at times, the curtain of the pupils
lifts, quietly--. An insight enters in,
rushes into the tense, unrested puzzle,
plunges into the heart and is gone.


=======================================
The Panther -= Rainer Maria Rilke

His vision, from the constantly passing bars,
has grown so weary that it cannot hold
anything else. It seems to him there are
a thousand bars; and behind the bars, no world.

As he paces in cramped circles, over and over,
the movement of his powerful soft strides
is like a ritual dance around a center
in which a mighty will stands paralyzed.

Only at times, the curtain of the pupils
lifts, quietly--. An image enters in,
rushes down through the tensed, arrested muscles,
plunges into the heart and is gone.

=================
I Am a Rock -- Paul Simon
(parody by Steve DeRose)

A writer's day
In a deep and dark
December
I am alone
Formatting my pages for the text I'll show
with some freshly printed silent ink to flow
I have no tags
I just have styles and they're grand...

I've got no rules
Nor schemas deep and mighty.
So none may validate!
I have no need of parsers, parsers cause me pain
It's valid, well-formed docs that I disdain
I have no tags
I just have styles and they're grand...

Don't talk "part of"
I've tried <section>s before
They're looping in my memory
I won't create a structure, of elements -- I've tried
If I never tagged I never would have cried
I have no tags
I just have styles and they're grand...

See how it looks!
With my kerning to protect me!
I am shielded from all syntax errs
Everything's a root; safer to compute
I tag nothing and no one validates.
I have no tags
I just have styles and they're grand....

For a block causes pain
But a style can never die.

I Am a Rock -- Paul Simon

A winter's day
In a deep and dark
December
I am alone
Gazing from my window to the streets below
On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow
I am a rock
I am an island

I've built walls
A fortress deep and mighty
That none may penetrate
I have no need of friendship, friendship causes pain
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain
I am a rock
I am an island

Don't talk of love
I've heard the words before
It's sleeping in my memory
I won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died
If I never loved I never would have cried
I am a rock
I am an island

I have my books
And my poetry to protect me
I am shielded in my armor
Hiding in my room, safe within my womb
I touch no one and no one touches me
I am a rock
I am an island

And a rock feels no pain
And an island never cries

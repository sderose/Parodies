V's Introduction, from V for Vendetta
(parody by Steve DeRose)

Voila! Text viewed, via a humble verifying validator, cast variously as victim
or villain by the vicissitudes of Schemata. The view, no mere veneer of
visiglpyphs, is a vestige of the virtual tree, now vacant, vanished. Despite the
violet visitation of a Windows vexation, verily it runs virtualized and serves
to vanquish the <volant> and /virgulous vermin violating trees and vouchsafing
the vorpally avulsive violation of validity.

The viridian verdict is "valid"; a vindication, held to a schema, not a vote,
for the value of veracity shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the valid.
Verily, this vichyssoise of taggage veers most verbose, so let me simply add
that it's a very good model for markup, and you may call it XML.

Voilà! In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran, cast vicariously as both victim
and villain by the vicissitudes of Fate. This visage, no mere veneer of vanity,
is a vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished. However, this valorous
visitation of a by-gone vexation, stands vivified and has vowed to vanquish
these venal and virulent vermin vanguarding vice and vouchsafing the violently
vicious and voracious violation of volition. 

The only verdict is vengeance; a vendetta, held as a votive, not in vain, for
the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the
virtuous. Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose, so let me
simply add that it's my very good honor to meet you and you may call me V.

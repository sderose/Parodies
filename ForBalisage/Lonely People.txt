===============================
"Lonely People" -- America
(parody by Steve DeRose)

This is for all the lonely authors
Thinking review has passed them by
Don't give up until you publish in Balisage
And ride that highway in the sky

This is for all the single breakthroughs
Thinking it not so worth a try
Don't give up until you submit to Balisage
You never know until you try

Well, I'm on my way
Yes, I'm back to stay
Well, I'm on my way back home (Hit it)

This is for all the lonely authors
Thinking review has passed them by
Don't give up until you publish in Balisage
We'll never take you down or tell you to give up
You never know until you try


===============================
"Lonely People" -- America

This is for all the lonely people
Thinking that life has passed them by
Don't give up until you drink from the silver cup
And ride that highway in the sky

This is for all the single people
Thinking that love has left them dry
Don't give up until you drink from the silver cup
You never know until you try

Well, I'm on my way
Yes, I'm back to stay
Well, I'm on my way back home (Hit it)

This is for all the lonely people
Thinking that life has passed them by
Don't give up until you drink from the silver cup
And never take you down or never give you up
You never know until you try

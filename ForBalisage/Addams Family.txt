==================
The Addams Family -- Lyrics by Vic Mizzy
(parody by Steve DeRose)

They're creaky and they're glitt'ry,
Closed up like a walled city,
Though sometimes they are pretty,
The files in PDF.

A pixel mausoleum
You have to print to see 'em
They really make you scream
The files in PDF.

So join the Autobahn
Use tags and Schematron
Get to the denouement
With XML instead.


==================
The Addams Family -- Lyrics by Vic Mizzy

They're creepy and they're kooky,
Mysterious and spooky,
They're altogether ooky,
The Addams Family.

Their house is a museum
When people come to see 'em
They really are a scream
The Addams Family.

[snap twice]
(Neat)
[snap twice]
(Sweet)
[snap twice]
(Petite)

So get a witch's shawl on
A broomstick you can crawl on
We're gonna pay a call on
The Addams Family.

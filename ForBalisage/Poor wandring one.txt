Poor wand'ring one! -- Pirates of Penzance
(parody by Steve DeRose)

Poor auth'ring one!
Though thou hast surely mistagged
Look at each space
Thy tags replace
Poor auth'ring one!

Poor auth'ring one!
If such a schema as mine
Can help thee find
Text you can mine
Why, take it, it is thine!

[CHORUS OF GIRLS]
Take our PDF stores;
Nake any text, then it's ours!

[MABEL]
Tag smart, your text refine;
Take any schema -- take mine!

[CHORUS OF GIRLS]
Take our PDF store;
Nake any text, then it's ours!

[MABEL]
Tag smart, your text refine;
Take any schema -- take mine!
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!
Poor auth'ring one!
Though thou hast surely mistagged
Look at each space

Poor auth'ring one!

[MABEL]
Ah, ah! Ah, ah, ah!

[CHORUS OF GIRLS]
Poor auth'ring one!
Poor auth'ring one!

Nuke any schema
But ours! Take ours! Take ours!
Take our PDF stores;
Nake any text, then it's ours!
Take ours, take ours,
Nake any text, then it's ours!
Take our.

Poor wand'ring one! -- Pirates of Penzance

Poor wand'ring one!
Though thou hast surely strayed
Take heart of grace
Thy steps retrace
Poor wand'ring one!

Poor wand'ring one!
If such poor love as mine
Can help thee find
True peace of mind
Why, take it, it is thine!

[CHORUS OF GIRLS]
Take heart, no danger low'rs;
Take any heart but ours!

[MABEL]
Take heart, fair days will shine;
Take any heart -- take mine!

[CHORUS OF GIRLS]
Take heart; no danger low'rs;
Take any heart -- but ours!

[MABEL]
Take heart, fair days will shine;
Take any heart -- take mine!

Though thou hast surely strayed
Take heart of grace
Thy steps retrace
Poor wandering one
[MABEL]
Ah, ah! Ah, ah, ah!
Ah, ah! Ah, ah, ah!
Fair days will shine
Take heart!

Take heart, no danger lowers!
Take any heart, but ours!
Take heart, take heart,
Take any heart but ours,
Take heart.

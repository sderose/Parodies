Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good night -- Dylan Thomas
(parody by Steve DeRose)

Do not go gentle into MarkDown-light,
A sage should learn that start and close are tied;
Rage, rage against the punctuation blight.

Though wise men at their end know tags are right,
Having no tags they must with whitespace play.
Do not go gentle into MarkDown-light.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their failed screeds might have danced in TEI,
Rage, rage against the punctuation blight.

Wild men who scanned and laid the text out right,
Yet learn, too late, they gave space, star full sway.
Do not go gentle into MarkDown-light.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight,
Plain text displayed like meteors if 'twer tagged --
Rage, rage against the punctuation blight.

And you, my parser, there on the sad height,
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into MarkDown-light.
Rage, rage against the punctuation blight.

Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good night -- Dylan Thomas

Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

And you, my father, there on the sad height,
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

The Balisage: (parody by Steve DeRose)

There once was a markup jubilee,
The name of it all was the Balisage spree
The geeks signed up, their bosses frowned --
but go, you XML pros (huh)

[Chorus]
Soon may the Balisage come
To bring us speakers and tags and fun
Friday, when the taggin' is done
We'll hear Michael and go.

Then only two weeks before
there down on her a paper bore
The chairman called the board and swore
She'd take that paper now (huh)

[Chorus]

Da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

Before it even hit the parser
The paper's tags came up and caught her
All hands to the file, retagged and fought her
When she crashed the site (huh)

[Chorus]

No word was cut, no tag unkeyed
The paper's structure not agreed
For Balisage has the Tagman's creed
They took that text in tow (huh)

[Chorus]

Da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

For forty days or even more
The parse went bad then right once more
All notes were lost, there were only four
That paper still: no go (huh)

[Chorus]

As far as I've heard, the fight's still on
No valid text, so R&R;
Next Balisage posts its regular call
To encourage the paper, bugs and all (huh)

[Chorus]

=====================================
The Wellerman

There once was a ship that put to sea
The name of the ship was the Billy of Tea
The winds blew up, her bow dipped down
Oh blow, my bully boys, blow (huh)

[Chorus]
Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
One day, when the tonguing is done
We'll take our leave and go

She'd not been two weeks from shore
When down on her a right whale bore
The captain called all hands and swore
He'd take that whale in tow (huh)

[Chorus]

Da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Before the boat had hit the water
The whale's tail came up and caught her
All hands to the side, harpooned and fought her
When she dived down low (huh)

[Chorus]

No line was cut, no whale was freed
The captain's mind was not of greed
And he belonged to the Whaleman's creed
She took that ship in tow (huh)
Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
One day, when the tonguing is done
We'll take our leave and go

Da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
For forty days or even more
The line went slack then tight once more
All boats were lost, there were only four
But still that whale did go (huh)

[Chorus]

As far as I've heard, the fight's still on
The line's not cut, and the whale's not gone
The Wellerman makes his regular call
To encourage the captain, crew and all (huh)

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

=======================================
Sonnet 29
by William Shakespeare

When, in disgrace with parsers that just freeze,
I all alone beweep my ill-tagged state,
And fail at rendering my rootless trees,
And look upon myself, and long for Jade,
Wishing me like to one more rich in tropes,
Structured like him, like him with end-tags blessed,
Desiring this one's start and that one's scope,
With formatting I have contented least;
Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,
Haply XSLT —- and then my state,
Like to the markup elements arising
From plain text birthed, sing hymns at heaven's gate;
   For my sweet text restructured such wealth brings
   That then I scorn to change my state with kings.

Sonnet 29
by William Shakespeare

When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,
I all alone beweep my outcast state,
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
And look upon myself, and curse my fate,
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,
Desiring this man's art and that man's scope,
With what I most enjoy contented least;
Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,
Haply I think on thee—and then my state,
Like to the lark at break of day arising
From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;
   For thy sweet love rememb'red such wealth brings
   That then I scorn to change my state with kings.

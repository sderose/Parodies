================================

I tried to make text rigorous
And thought I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was
Until I parsed you

Parse defeat
Incomplete
No end-tags, I was sad and blue
But OMITTAG makes
Yeah, OMITTAG makes
El'ments all new

Hoo...
Tags are merged-in
Structured for the very first time
Tags are merged-in
Where "p" starts but,
can't nest inside

Schema gives you all my rules, boy
Parser upgrading fast
Been saving it all for you
'Cause only root can last

But inline
Soup's just fine
Make text <strong>, yeah or make it <bold>
Oh your text laid out
Yeah, your text laid out
Underscored in gold

Tags are merged in, hey
Structured for the very first time
Tags are merged-in
With your schema
Just in time

Whoa
Whoa, ah
Whoa

Kern so fine
for each line
I'll be yours
'Til the end of time
'Cause you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
I've nothing to hide

tags are merged in, hey
Touched for the very first time
tags are merged in
With your heartbeat
Next to mine

tags are merged in, ooh ooh
tags are merged in
Feels so good inside
When you hold me
And your heart beats
And you love me

Oh oh, ooh whoa


================================

I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was
Until I found you

I was beat
Incomplete
I'd been had, I was sad and blue
But you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
Shiny and new

Hoo, like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats
Next to mine

Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you
'Cause only love can last

You're so fine
And you're mine
Make me strong, yeah you make me bold
Oh your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out
What was scared and cold

Like a virgin, hey
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat
Next to mine

Whoa
Whoa, ah
Whoa

You're so fine
And you're mine
I'll be yours
'Til the end of time
'Cause you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
I've nothing to hide

Like a virgin, hey
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat
Next to mine

Like a virgin, ooh ooh
Like a virgin
Feels so good inside
When you hold me
And your heart beats
And you love me

Oh oh, ooh whoa

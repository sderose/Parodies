=======================================
O Rose thou art sick -- William Blake
(parody by Steve DeRose)

O prose thou art sick.
The omissible tag,
Implied in the night
in its lack, ill-formed:

Has found out thy end
Of valid joy:
And thy stark schema love
Does thy parse destroy.


=======================================
O Rose thou art sick -- William Blake

O Rose thou art sick.
The invisible worm,
That flies in the night
In the howling storm:

Has found out thy bed
Of crimson joy:
And his dark secret love
Does thy life destroy.

=======================================
William Blake

O prose thou art sick.
The omitted tag,
That fails in the night
in its foul, ill form:

Has found out thy end
Of valid joy:
And his stark schema love
Does thy parse destroy.


=======================================
William Blake

O Rose thou art sick.
The invisible worm,
That flies in the night
In the howling storm:

Has found out thy bed
Of crimson joy:
And his dark secret love
Does thy life destroy.

Sister Golden Hair -- America

Well I tried to tag on Sunday, but I got so damn depressed
That I set my sights on Monday and I got myself unstressed
I ain't ready for the schema but I do agree there's times
When a parser sure can be a friend of mine.

Well, I keep on thinkin' 'bout you, system scolds for errs -- surprise!
And I just can't live without you, can't you validate my tries?
I got one big batch of content; bugs are too, too hard to find
But it just means validation's on my mind.

Will you meet me in the middle, or must all my tags be paired?
Will you spot me just a little, just enough to show you care?
Well I tried to fake it, I don't mind sayin', I just can't make it.

Well, I keep on thinkin' 'bout you, system scolds for errs -- surprise!
And I just can't ship without you, as I see how my code dies.
Now I'm getting more despondent, bugs are still too hard to find
But it just means validation's on my mind.

Will you meet me in the middle, or must all my tags be paired?
Will you spot me just a little, just enough to show you care?
Well I tried to fake it, I don't mind sayin', I just can't make it.

Doo wop doo wop...

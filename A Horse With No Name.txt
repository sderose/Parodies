"A Horse With No Name" -- America

On the first part of the journey
I was looking at all the tags
There were <part>s and <div>s and <note>s and things
There was <span> and fills and strings
The first thing untagged was a "li" -- with no star;
then a cite untied from its note;
Of heads now none, and tables naught a try.
But the tabs were all around.

I've been through the desert of a source with no tags
It felt good to be out of the pain
With no parser you can dismember your tags
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la la la la, la la la, la la...
La, la, la la la la, la la la, la la...

After two days with no parser runs
My screen began to go dead
After three days with no parser fun
Work was slowing with ten more threads
And the story it told of text runs that flowed
Made me sad to think it was dead.

You see I've been through the desert of a source with no tags
It felt good to be out of the pain
With no parser you can dismember your tags
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la la la la, la la la, la la...

After nine days I let the tags back in
And the desert was turned to sea
There were <part>s and <div>s and <note>s and things
There was <span> and fills and strings
The markup is a story with its life underground
And a perfect disguise all above
Under the layout lies a heart hidden 'round
But the authors will give no love.

You see I've been through the desert of a source with no tags
It felt good to be out of the pain.
With no parser you can dismember your tags
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la la la la, la la la, la la... [repeats]

"A Horse With No Name" -- America

On the first part of the journey
I was looking at all the life
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
And the sky with no clouds
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sound

I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la la la la, la la la, la la...
La, la, la la la la, la la la, la la...

After two days in the desert sun
My skin began to turn red
After three days in the desert fun
I was looking at a river bed
And the story it told of a river that flowed
Made me sad to think it was dead

You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la la la la, la la la, la la...

After nine days I let the horse run free
'Cause the desert had turned to sea
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The ocean is a desert with its life underground
And a perfect disguise all above
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
But the humans will give no love

You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la la la la, la la la, la la... [repeats]

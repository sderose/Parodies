==============
"Dust in the Wind" -- Kansas

(unfinished)

I close my tags
Only with a bracket, and the el'ment's gone
Data streams
Pass before my eyes, a curiosity

Structure in mind
All we have is structure in mind

Same old song
Just a drop of one NULL ends a string in C
All we do
Crumbles to the ground, though we refuse to see

Structure in mind
All we have is structure in mind
Oh

Now, don't hang on
Nothin' lasts forever but the TEI.
Code slips away
And all your money won't another version buy

Structure in mind
All we have is structure in mind
(All we have is structure in mind)
Structure in mind
(Everything is structure in mind)
Everything is structure in mind
The mind


==============
"Dust in the Wind" -- Kansas

I close my eyes
Only for a moment, and the moment's gone
All my dreams
Pass before my eyes, a curiosity

Dust in the wind
All they are is dust in the wind

Same old song
Just a drop of water in an endless sea
All we do
Crumbles to the ground, though we refuse to see

Dust in the wind
All we are is dust in the wind
Oh

Now, don't hang on
Nothin' lasts forever but the earth and sky
It slips away
And all your money won't another minute buy

Dust in the wind
All we are is dust in the wind
(All we are is dust in the wind)
Dust in the wind
(Everything is dust in the wind)
Everything is dust in the wind
The wind

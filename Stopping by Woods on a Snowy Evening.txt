“Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening” -Robert Frost

Whose words these are I think I know.
His files are PDF, oh no!
He will not see me stopping here
To make his words be tagged and flow.

My little parse must think it queer
To stop without an element near
Between the words and tags I make
While normalizing there and here.

I give the test harness a shake
To see if there is some mistake.
Then more tags surround the sweep
For structure gained that does not break.

The trees now lovely, dark and deep,
But I have validness to reap,
And files to parse before I sleep,
And files to parse before I sleep.

“Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening” -Robert Frost

Whose woods these are I think I know.
His house is in the village though;
He will not see me stopping here
To watch his woods fill up with snow.

My little horse must think it queer
To stop without a farmhouse near
Between the woods and frozen lake
The darkest evening of the year.

He gives his harness bells a shake
To ask if there is some mistake.
The only other sound’s the sweep
Of easy wind and downy flake.

The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep,
And miles to go before I sleep.

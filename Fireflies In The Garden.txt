Fireflies In The Garden

Here come real nodes to fill ontologies,
And there in JSON nought but brace-like signs;
That though they never equal nodes in pow'r,
(And they were never really nodes at heart)
Achieve at times a very node-like start.
Only, of course, they can't sustain the part.

Fireflies In The Garden

Here come real stars to fill the upper skies,
And here on earth come emulating flies,
That though they never equal stars in size,
(And they were never really stars at heart)
Achieve at times a very star-like start.
Only, of course, they can't sustain the part.

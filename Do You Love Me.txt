"Will you tag me?" from Fiddler on the Roof.

Texye: Will you tag me?
Builder: Will I what?
Texye: Will you tag me?

Builder: Will I tag you?
With our e-books with no standards and book markets going down,
You're a page. You want fonts. Text inside. Go to town!
Maybe it's validation.

Texye: Builder, I'm making a suggestion. Will you tag me?
Builder: You're a fool!
Texye: I know. But will you tag me?

Builder: Will I tag you?
For twenty-five years, I've swashed your "O"s,
Dropped your caps, kerned your flows;
bound you with gilded silk -- highbrow!
After twenty-five years, why talk about tags right now?

Texye: The first time I met you was in a type-filled tray. I was lead.
Builder: I was high.
Texye: I was kern-ed.
Builder: Beautify!

Texye: And the typist at my pub-house said it's all the same in layouts.
Yet, now I'm asking, Builder...
Texye: Will you tag me?
Builder: That's just strife!
Texye: I know. But will you tag me?

Builder: Will I tag him?
For twenty-five years, no rivers in,
orphans -- none! Kerns so thin.
For twenty-five years, my lead is his.
If not pages, what then?

Texye: Please, just tag me!
Builder: I suppose I will.
Texye: And then I'll let you format, too.

Together: The pages still can sing, but even so,
After twenty-five years, I'm now OHCO.

"Do you love me?" from Fiddler on the Roof.

Tevye: Do you love me?
Golde: Do I what?
Tevye: Do you love me?

Golde: Do I love you?
With our daughters getting married and this trouble in the town,
You're upset. You want out. Go inside. Go lie down.
Maybe it's indigestion.

Tevye: Golde, I'm asking you a question. Do you love me?
Golde: You're a fool!
Tevye: I know. But do you love me?

Golde: Do I love you?
For twenty-five years, I've washed your clothes,
Cooked your meals, cleaned your house,
Given you children, milked the cow.
After twenty-five years, why talk about love right now?

Tevye: The first time I met you was on our wedding day. I was scared.
Golde: I was shy.
Tevye: I was nervous.
Golde: So was I.

Tevye: But my father and my father said we'd learn to love each other.
So, now I'm asking, Golde...
Tevye: Do you love me?
Golde: I'm your wife!
Tevye: I know. But do you love me?

Golde: Do I love him?
For twenty-five years, I've lived with him,
Fought with him, starved with him.
For twenty-five years, my bed is his.
If that's not love, what is?

Tevye: Then you love me?
Golde: I suppose I do.
Tevye: And I suppose I love you, too.

Together: It doesn't change a thing, but even so,
After twenty-five years, it's nice to know

This repo contains parodies i've put together, rewriting well-known poems,
songs, or scenes. Take in small doses, PRN.

They vary in polish (to say the least); the least-finished are under "Drafts/",
and ones unstarted (or nearly so) are under "Potential/" (though I don't usually
check those in to git at all).

Most refer to markup and documents, and those should be in subdirectory
"ForBalisage". Several have been presented at the
Balisage conference's "Balisage Bard" events.
If you're not up on the XML ecosystem, these may make no sense to you.
If you are, you may (I hope) find them amusing.

Be sure also to see the marvelous TEI songs by Syd Bauman and Julia Flanders,
at [https://tei-c.org/Vault/Songs/].

=======================================
Sea Fever -- John Masefield
(parody by Steve DeRose)

I must walk down through the trees again, so the lonely leaves all comply,
And all I ask is a bash script, and a parser to run thereby.
My XSL's sick and the mode's wrong, with structure fails waking;
with a great mess in the tree’s place: another dawn breaking.

I must walk down through the trees again, with the call in the template's mode:
A compiled call, a FLWOR call that may not be o'errode;
And all I ask is right display with the right code applying,
No text astray and no blown stack; output verifying.

I must walk down through the trees again, errors flagrant, typsy, rife --
Next the tag-ful way, the no-fail way where the parser may yet survive.
And all I ask is a good Sauterne from a laughing fellow-coder,
And quiet sleep and a sweet dream when the long kick’s over.


=======================================
“Sea Fever” -- John Masefield

I must go down to the seas again, to the lonely sea and the sky,
And all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by;
And the wheel’s kick and the wind’s song and the white sail’s shaking,
And a grey mist on the sea’s face, and a grey dawn breaking.

I must go down to the seas again, for the call of the running tide
Is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied;
And all I ask is a windy day with the white clouds flying,
And the flung spray and the blown spume, and the sea-gulls crying.

I must go down to the seas again, to the vagrant gypsy life,
To the gull’s way and the whale’s way where the wind’s like a whetted knife;
And all I ask is a merry yarn from a laughing fellow-rover,
And quiet sleep and a sweet dream when the long trick’s over.

====================
Penny Lane - The Beatles

At parsing time, there is a tagger marking up page-proofs
Of every <head> he's had the pleasure to close
With all the table cells in a row,
Clipped on overflow.

Oh the tagger is a wanker with a space-bar
And even JSON laughs at him behind his back
And the wanker never cared for Mac
Or for Oxygen (very strange).

Parsing pain is in <tr>s and in <li>s
There without the tags that others prize.

He sits, and meanwhile back
At parsing time he's checking hyphens with a looking-glass
Though in his pocket is a book from S-McQueen
He likes to keep his "plain text" files clean
With no markup seen.

Parsing pain is in his ears and in his eyes
Ignoring the advice of Wendell Piez

In summer, meanwhile back
Behind the shell script running troff for the rendering
The pretty pages spooling one by one away
And though he feels like nothing's gone astray
It's in disarray.

At parsing time, the wanker shaves another custom kern
To fit the long words lest they break with more hyphens
And then the editor rushes in
saying "Re-arrange!" (very strange).

Parsing pain is in his ears and in his eyes
There without the tags that others prize.

He sits, and meanwhile back
Parsing pain is in his ears and in his eyes
For the lack of tags that others prize.

Parsing pain!


====================
Penny Lane - The Beatles

In Penny Lane, there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say, "Hello"

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
And little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain, very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back
Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway

In Penny Lane, the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane!

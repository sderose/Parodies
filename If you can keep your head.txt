=======================================
If -- Rudyard Kipling
(parody by Steve DeRose)

If you can keep your <head> when all about you
   Are losing <div>s and blaming it on you;
If you can validate when authors doubt you,
   But make allowance for their syntax too:
If you can parse and not be tired of tagging,
   Or, being called verbose, don't omit tags,
Or being hated don't give way to JSON,
   resort to JavaScript, nor use PIs;

If you can render -- and not make fonts your master;
   If you can tag -- and not make tags your aim,
If you can work with typesetter and browser
   And treat those two impostors just the same:

If you can bear to see your marked up objects
   Twisted by knaves to make "plain text" for fools,
Or watch the code you gave your life to, broken,
   Yet quickly use your texts with other tools;

If you can make one tree of all your entities
   And risk it on one run of Schematron,
And lose, and parse again from the beginning,
   And never kvetch at errs draconian:
If you can force your editors and writers
   To tag descriptively though nearing dawn,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
   Except the Will which says to them: "Tag on!"

If you can treat with Word and keep your virtue,
   Or use Exist -- nor lose the common touch,
If neither CSS nor TEX can hurt you,
   If all tags count with you, but none too much:
If you can pass the unforgiving parser
   With markup you built up from a tag salad,
Yours is the Earth and every text that's in it,
   And -- which is more -- you've XML -- and valid!


=======================================
The initial publication of the poem "If—" was in the "Brother Square Toes" chapter
    of the book Rewards and Fairies (1910), p 181.

If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,
  And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: “Hold on!”

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,
  And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son.

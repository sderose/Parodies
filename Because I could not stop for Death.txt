=======================================
Because I could not stop for Death -- Emily Dickinson
(parody by Steve DeRose)

Because I could not stop to parse
The parser stopped for me.
The output held but just Ourselves
And invalidity.

We slowly strove -- He knew no haste
And I had put away
My labor and my leisure too,
For His DOM structure tree.

We passed JSON, where Children play
At braces in a string
We passed the Fields of CSV
We passed PDF bling;

Or rather -- it passed us --
The ink sat hardening and chill
Format, mere Gossamer, locked down
The objects lost, gone, still

We paused before a page that showed
One layout on the Ground
The root was scarcely visible
The <corr> and <sic>s? Not found.

Since then -- 'tis Centuries -- and yet
Feels shorter than the Day
I first perceived the <section>s' <head>s
Were toward Eternity.


=======================================
Because I could not stop for Death -- Emily Dickinson

Because I could not stop for Death--
He kindly stopped for me--
The Carriage held but just Ourselves--
And Immortality.

We slowly drove--He knew no haste
And I had put away
My labor and my leisure too,
For His Civility--

We passed the School, where Children strove
At Recess--in the Ring--
We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain--
We passed the Setting Sun--

Or rather--He passed us--
The Dews drew quivering and chill--
For only Gossamer, my Gown--
My Tippet--only Tulle--

We paused before a House that seemed
A Swelling of the Ground--
The Roof was scarcely visible--
The Cornice--in the Ground--

Since then--'tis Centuries--and yet
Feels shorter than the Day
I first surmised the Horses' Heads
Were toward Eternity--

=======================================
The place where the sidewalk ends -- Shel Silverstein
(parody by Steve DeRose)

There is a place where the text node ends
And before the next begins,
And there the space is soft and white,
And like the sun burning crimson bright,
Just there the print-laser rests from his flight
To cool as the page feeder spins.

Let us leave this place where the ink draws back
And space rivers wind and bend.
Past the pixels where dingbat flowers grow
We shall draw there some glyphs that are measured and flow,
And watch where the chalk-white spaces go
At the place where the text node ends.

Yes we'll draw there some glyphs that are measured and flow,
And we'll go where the chalk-white spaces go,
For the child nodes, they mark, and the child nodes, they know
The place where the text node ends.


=======================================
The place where the sidewalk ends -- Shel Silverstein

There is a place where the sidewalk ends
And before the street begins,
And there the grass grows soft and white,
And there the sun burns crimson bright,
And there the moon-bird rests from his flight
To cool in the peppermint wind.

Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black
And the dark street winds and bends.
Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow
We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow,
And watch where the chalk-white arrows go
To the place where the sidewalk ends.

Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,
And we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go,
For the children, they mark, and the children, they know
The place where the sidewalk ends.

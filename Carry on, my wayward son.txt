=====================================
Carry on, my wayward son -- Kansas

[Chorus]
Carry on, val-i-da-tion
There'll be pages when you're done
Get your <div>s and <head>s to nest
Parse awry no more

[Verse 1]
Once I rose above the format perfusion
Tried to get to an extracted <conclusion>
I was rend'ring ever finer --
But I knew not why.
Though my eyes could see, I'm still a design fan
For my printer ink, I still had a grid plan
I saw ligatures when dreaming;
Then heard markup say

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Hyphenating 'til the words all had lesions
Text display was the intent; all my reason
And if I claim to be a wise man, well
It surely means that I don't know.
To a stylesheet giving undue devotion
Tossed about I'm pouring ink on the ocean.
I change my course to tag for structure,
And hear the markup say

[Chorus]

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Elements, you can always be rendered
Elements, nothing equals the splendor
Though your text's no longer trendy
Now search expressions work for you

[Chorus]


=====================================
Carry on, my wayward son -- Kansas

[Chorus]
Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

[Verse 1]
Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
I was soaring ever higher
But I flew too high
Though my eyes could see, I still was a blind man
Though my mind could think, I still was a mad man
I hear the voices when I'm dreaming
I can hear them say

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Masquerading as a man with a reason
My charade is the event of the season
And if I claim to be a wise man, well
It surely means that I don't know
On a stormy sea of moving emotion
Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune
But I hear the voices say

[Chorus]

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Carry on, you will always remember
Carry on, nothing equals the splendor
Now your life's no longer empty
But surely heaven waits for you

[Chorus]

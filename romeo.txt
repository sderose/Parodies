O XML, XML, wherefore art thou XML?
Deny thy schema and refuse thy namespace;
Or if thou wilt not, be well-formed, my love;
And I’ll accept to be with tags beset.
‘Tis but thy names that give validity:
Thou art thyself, e'en mapped to untagged stew.
What’s untagged stew? It hath not <handNote>, <mood>,
Nor <milestone/>, <place>, nor even <witStart>
Belonging to a plan. O use some other names.
What’s in a name? That which we tag as prose,
By any font name would as well I clepe;
So XML would, were he not extensible call’d,
Retain that page perfection which he owes
With <font> for <title>. XML, doff thy names,
And for those names, which are no part of thee,
Take all my style.

O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name.
Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet.
‘Tis but thy name that is my enemy:
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
What’s Montague? It is nor hand nor foot
Nor arm nor face nor any other part
Belonging to a man. O be some other name.
What’s in a name? That which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet;
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call’d,
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
And for that name, which is no part of thee,
Take all myself.

==========================
The screen glows white
On the mon'tor tonight;
Not an error to be seen

Strong types for validation --
Rust makes code that's pretty clean.

The Web is howling
with exploits to get inside;
Couldn’t keep them out
Heaven knows I tried….

Don’t let them in
Don’t code in C --
Be the good dev you always have to be

Construct! Don’t free()
Don’t let them know…
Well, now they know!

Let it go, let it go
Can’t hold it back anymore

Let it go, let it go
Turn to Rust and slam the door!

I don’t care what they’re going to say
Let the storm rage on --
The code never bothered me anyway.

It’s funny how strict type checks
Make the debugging seem small
And the fears that once controlled me
Can’t get to me at all!

It’s time to see What I can do
To test the limits and break through

No malloc means no bugs for me --
No free()!

Let it go! Let it go!
I am one with the code I write!

Let it go! Let it go!
You’ll never see me cry!

Here I stand, and here I’ll stay
Let the storm rage on…

My power flurries through the air into the ground
My code is compíling with zero warnings all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast:
I’m never going back The past is in the past!

Let it go! Let it go!
And I’ll rise like the break of dawn!

Let it go! Let it go!
Those C string NULs are gone!

Here I stand in the light of day…
Let the storm rage on!!!

The code never bothered me anyway.


=====================
The snow glows white
On the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen

A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I’m the Queen

The wind is howling
Like this swirling storm inside

Couldn’t keep it in
Heaven knows I tried…

Don’t let them in
Don’t let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be

Conceal
Don’t feel
Don’t let them know…

Well, now they know!

Let it go, let it go
Can’t hold it back anymore

Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door!

I don’t care what they’re going to say
Let the storm rage on

The cold never bothered me anyway

It’s funny how some distance
Makes everything seem small

And the fears that once controlled me
Can’t get to me at all!

It’s time to see What I can do
To test the limits and break through

No right, no wrong No rules for me
I’m free!

Let it go! Let it go!
I am one with the wind and sky!

Let it go! Let it go!
You’ll never see me cry!

Here I stand and here I’ll stay
Let the storm rage on…

My power flurries through the air into the ground

My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around

And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast

I’m never going back The past is in the past!

Let it go! Let it go!
And I’ll rise like the break of dawn!

Let it go! Let it go!
That perfect girl is gone!

Here I stand in the light of day…
Let the storm rage on!!!

The cold never bothered me anyway

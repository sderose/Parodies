(to the tune of "The Girl from Ipanema")

Called by man and called by God
the Pope from Argentina goes walking
and when he blesses, 
each one he blesses goes -- Ahhhhh(men).

When he speaks it's ex cathedral
encyclicals addressed to gentiles; 
so like Saint Francis, 
each one he glances says -- papa!

Ooh, but we watch him to see:
how will he show us God loves us?
Then, we would give our hearts gladly,
if each day when he walks to the See,
he looks not at man but at Thee.

Called by man and called by God
the Pope from Argentina goes walking
and when he blesses, 
each one he blesses goes -- Ahhhhh(men).

Surfer Girl (The Beach Boys)
(parody by Steve DeRose)

Little gamer, little one
Made my heart come all undone

[Chorus]
Do you love me, do you, gamer girl?
gamer girl, my little gamer girl

[Verse 2]
I have watched you on the screen
Hacking down the other team

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
We could do side quests together
While our loot would grow
In my party, I would take you
Everywhere I go

[Verse 3]
So I say from me to you
I will make your dreams come true

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Girl, gamer girl, my little gamer girl
Girl, gamer girl, my little gamer girl
Girl, gamer girl, my little gamer girl

Surfer Girl (The Beach Boys)

Little surfer, little one
Made my heart come all undone

[Chorus]
Do you love me, do you, surfer girl?
Surfer girl, my little surfer girl

[Verse 2]
I have watched you on the shore
Standing by the ocean's roar

[Chorus]
Do you love me, do you, surfer girl?
Surfer girl, my little surfer girl

[Bridge]
We could ride the surf together
While our love would grow
In my woody, I would take you
Everywhere I go

[Verse 3]
So I say from me to you
I will make your dreams come true

[Chorus]
Do you love me, do you, surfer girl?
Surfer girl, my little surfer girl

[Outro]
Girl, surfer girl, my little surfer girl
Girl, surfer girl, my little surfer girl
Girl, surfer girl, my little surfer girl

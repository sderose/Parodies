========================
Margaritaville (Jimmy Buffett)
Wasting away from a coronavirus (parody by Steve DeRose)

Livin' on hotcakes
Watching the outbreak
All of my food stock starting to spoil
Strumming my six string
Inside for safety
Smell sterilizers beginnin' to boil.

Wastin' away again from a coronavirus
Searchin' for my lost surgical mask
Some people claim that it's the Chinese to blame
But I know it's the government's fault.

Don't know the reason
It's worse than flu season
Nothin' to treat this brand new Swine Flu
From bats or from monkeys
To every country
How it got here I haven't a clue.

Wastin' away again from a coronavirus
Searchin' for my lost surgical mask
Some people claim that it's the Chinese to blame
Now I think, hell it could be Trump's fault.

Don't breathe out at bus stops
Don't let your face-mask drop!
Don't touch your face or you cruise on back home
Where there's booze for a bender
And soon it will render
You dozin' from re-runs that help you hang on.

Wastin' away again from a coronavirus
Searchin' for my lost surgical mask
Some people claim that it's the Chinese to blame
Now I think, hell it could be Trump's fault.
Yes and some people claim that it's the Chinese to blame
And I know it's my own damn fault


========================
Margaritaville (Jimmy Buffett)

Nibblin' on sponge cake
Watchin' the sun bake
All of those tourists covered with oil
Strummin' my six string on my front porch swing
Smell those shrimp they're beginnin' to boil

Wastin' away again in Margaritaville
Searchin' for my long lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
But I know it's nobody's fault

Don't know the reason
Stayed here all season
Nothing to show but this brand new tattoo
But it's a real beauty
A Mexican cutie
How it got here I haven't a clue

Wastin' away again in Margaritaville
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
Now I think hell it could be my fault

I blew out my flip flop
Stepped on a pop top
Cut my heel had to cruise on back home
But there's booze in the blender
And soon it will render
That frozen concoction that helps me hang on

Wastin' away again in Margaritaville
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
But I know it's my own damn fault
Yes and some people claim that there's a woman to blame
And I know it's my own damn fault

=======================================

Tagger Tagger parsing right,
Through tag forests in the night;
What immortal hand or eye,
Dare break thy pointy symmetry?

In what nested deeps of ease,
Broke the limits of thy trees?
On what wings dared he cross quires?
What the hand, lit stacks on fire?

And what modeler, & what art,
O'erlaps the brackets, end and start?
And when thy bounds began to meet,
What chiasms? what crossed feet?

How to <join> them? How to chain?
The CONCUR furnace still remains.
What of LiM'NaL? What of Clix?
Dare their deadly models risk!

When the trees threw down their leaves
And water'd heaven with their tears:
Did he smile o'erlap to see?
Did he who made the graph make thee?

Tagger Tagger parsing right,
Through tag forests in the night;
What immortal hand or eye,
Dare break thy pointy symmetry?


=======================================
William Blake

Tyger Tyger, burning bright,
In the forests of the night;
What immortal hand or eye,
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?

In what distant deeps or skies,
Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
On what wings dare he aspire?
What the hand, dare seize the fire?

And what shoulder, & what art,
Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
And when thy heart began to beat,
What dread hand? & what dread feet?

What the hammer? what the chain,
In what furnace was thy brain?
What the anvil? what dread grasp,
Dare its deadly terrors clasp!

When the stars threw down their spears
And water'd heaven with their tears:
Did he smile his work to see?
Did he who made the Lamb make thee?

Tyger Tyger burning bright,
In tag forests of the night:
What immortal hand or eye,
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?

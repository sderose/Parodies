=======================================
John Donne

No tag is an island,
Entire of itself;
Every tag is a piece with the content,
A part of the DOM.
If a <quote> be washed away by XSLT,
Your data is the less,
As well as if a directory were;
As well as if a folder of thy friend's
Or of thine own were.
Any tag's loss diminishes me,
Because I am involved in data mining.
And therefore never send to know for whom the tag toils;
It toils for thee.


[or: As well as if a row, cite, or b were]

If a X be washed away:
    emph
    tag
    dot
    bracket
    lt (ell tee)

washed away
    deleted
    entified
    escaped


=======================================
John Donne

No man is an island,
Entire of itself;
Every man is a piece of the continent,
A part of the main.
If a clod be washed away by the sea,
Europe is the less,
As well as if a promontory were:
As well as if a manor of thy friend's
Or of thine own were.
Any man's death diminishes me,
Because I am involved in mankind.
And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;
It tolls for thee.

=======================================
Hope is the Thing with Feathers
Emily Dickinson

“Markup” is the thing that measures –
That perches in the prose –
And forms the text without the words –
And never stops – at all –

And clearest – in the tags – is heard –
Yet poor is the transform –
That could abolish the little tree
That kept the work's sure form –

I’ve seen it in the scribal hand –
And in typography –
Yet – never – save validity,
It asked a crumb – of me.


=======================================
Hope is the Thing with Feathers
Emily Dickinson

“Hope” is the thing with feathers –
That perches in the soul –
And sings the tune without the words –
And never stops – at all –

And sweetest – in the Gale – is heard –
And sore must be the storm –
That could abash the little Bird
That kept so many warm –

I’ve heard it in the chillest land –
And on the strangest Sea –
Yet – never – in Extremity,
It asked a crumb – of me.

Lola
(parody by Steve DeRose)


I saw a directory in jscript/all
Where you download a file and it looks just like
You're in JSON
J-S-O-N JSON
I loaded it up and it asked for my pass
I asked what it was and the file extension said, "JSON"
J-S-O-N JSON, no no no no JSON

Well, I'm not the world's most logical guy
But when it loaded in core my firewall resigned
Oh my JSON, no no no no JSON
Well, I'm not dumb but I can't understand
Why it looked like just data but eval'ed and then ran
Oh my JSON, no no no no JSON, no no no no JSON

Well, that's an insane and fanciful blight
Under electric candlelight
She forked jobs up and rootkitted me
She said, "Little boy, format /dev with me?"
Well, I'm not the world's most passionate guy
But 'til it made my code die
Well, I almost tried to use JSON
No no no no JSON, no no no no JSON
JSON, no no no no JSON, no no no no JSON

I pushed her away
I walked to the door
I fell to the floor
My screen is still froze.
Then I looked at her, and she at me
Well, that's the way that I want it to stay
And I always want it to be that way for my JSON
No no no no JSON
Data is code, and code is data
It's a mixed up, muddled up, shook up world
Except for JSON
No no no no JSON

Well, I'd left home just a week before
And I'd never ever validated before
But JSON smiled and took me by the hand
She said, "Little boy, gonna make you a man"
Well, I'm not the world's most structur-ed man
But I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man
And so is JSON
No no no no JSON, no no no no JSON

JSON, no no no no JSON, no no no no JSON
JSON, no no no no JSON, no no no no JSON
JSON, no no no no JSON, no no no no JSON
JSON, no no no no JSON, no no no no JSON
JSON, no no no no JSON, no no no no JSON

Lola

I met her in a club down in old Soho
Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like
Cherry Cola
C-O-L-A Cola
She walked up to me and she asked me to dance
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said, "Lola"
L-O-L-A Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola

Well, I'm not the world's most physical guy
But when she squeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine
Oh my Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Well, I'm not dumb but I can't understand
Why she walked like a woman but talked like a man
Oh my Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola

Well, we drank champagne and danced all night
Under electric candlelight
She picked me up and sat me on her knee
She said, "Little boy, won't you come home with me?"
Well, I'm not the world's most passionate guy
But when I looked in her eyes
Well, I almost fell for my Lola
Lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola

I pushed her away
I walked to the door
I fell to the floor
I got down on my knees
Then I looked at her, and she at me
Well, that's the way that I want it to stay
And I always want it to be that way for my Lola
Lo lo lo lo Lola
Girls will be boys, and boys will be girls
It's a mixed up, muddled up, shook up world
Except for Lola
Lo lo lo lo Lola

Well, I'd left home just a week before
And I'd never ever kissed a woman before
But Lola smiled and took me by the hand
She said, "Little boy, gonna make you a man"
Well, I'm not the world's most masculine man
But I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man
And so is Lola
Lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola

Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
